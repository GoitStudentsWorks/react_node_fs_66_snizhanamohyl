Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 mins.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling, salted water, according to packet instructions. Drain well, run hot water through it, put it back in the pan and add a dash of olive oil, if you like, then stir in the meat sauce.
